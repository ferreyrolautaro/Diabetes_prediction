# Models for early diabetes prediction

Using a sample of 4200 Chinese adults, which has 18 features collected from blood tests and triage, several data analysis were driven, in order to model a consistent way to predict if a patient is diabetic.
The first step was to plot histograms for each numerical feature and box plots for categorical features. The numerical exploration revealed either symmetric or slightly skewed distributions. Then, considering that some of the feats where combinations of other feats or weren't quiet relevant, we run 3 classification algorithms to find the best combination of 7 diferent features, so the computational cost remains low while offering good metrics values.
